🧠 Project Overview

Predictive Eye Detection is a machine learning–based system designed to automatically detect eyes in facial images and identify abnormalities or key eye features for medical or security applications. The project uses image processing and classification techniques to accurately analyze eye regions using modern machine learning models.

This system supports real-time detection and can be integrated with advanced medical screening tools, biometric systems, and assistive technologies.

🚀 Features

Automatic eye region detection from facial images

ML-based classification for improved accuracy

Real-time prediction using webcam or image input

Image processing techniques for noise removal & enhancement

Model built using supervised learning / deep learning CNN

High-accuracy detection and fast prediction response
